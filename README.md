# This is my Raspberry Pi PICO dev repo

### A place to keep PICO projects and code them with vscode.dev

Pico SDK is required.

This is a Raspberry Pi PICO SDK set up that I am using on Redhat in order to learn and code the PICO.  

It is a work in progress and is described in a series of blog posts at <a href="https://tardis1.wordpress.com/2021/12/31/how-to-install-the-raspberry-pi-pico-sdk-on-redhat-8-part-i/">The T.A.R.D.I.S. Server project</a>.

You may fork this as you wish.  Some of the code will be from the Raspberry Pi PICO C/C++ manual. As always, use at your own risk.
